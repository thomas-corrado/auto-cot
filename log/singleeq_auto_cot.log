To find the difference between the two lines, we need to subtract the length of the blue line from the length of the white line. 7.666666666666667 - 3.3333333333333335 = 4.333333333333334 inches. The white line is 4.333333333333334 inches longer than the blue line. The answer is 4.333333333333334 inches.

Q: Trenton sells electronic supplies. Each week he earns 190 dollars plus commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. This week his goal is to earn no less than 500 dollars. How much sales  he must make to reach his goal?
A: Let's think step by step. Trenton earns 190 dollars plus commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. This week his goal is to earn no less than 500 dollars. We can set up an equation to represent this situation: 190 + 0.04x = 500, where x represents his sales. To solve for x, we need to subtract 190 from both sides, giving us 0.04x = 310. Then, we divide both sides by 0.04 to isolate x, giving us x = 7750. This means that Trenton must make at least $7750 in sales to reach his goal of earning no less than $500. The answer is $7750.

Q: For his long distance phone service Milan pays a 2 dollars monthly fee plus 12 cents per minute. Last month , Milan 's long distance bill was 23.36 dollars. For how many minutes was Milan billed for ?
A: Let's think step by step. Milan pays a 2 dollars monthly fee plus 12 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's long distance bill was 23.36 dollars. This means that the 2 dollars monthly fee is already included in the total bill. So we need to subtract 2 dollars from 23.36 dollars to find out how much he was billed for the minutes. 23.36 - 2 = 21.36. Now we need to divide 21.36 by 0.12 (since 12 cents is equivalent to 0.12 dollars) to find out how many minutes he was billed for. 21.36/0.12 = 178. Therefore, Milan was billed for 178 minutes. The answer is 178.
