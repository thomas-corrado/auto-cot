Q: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Let's think step by step. The cost of purchasing new tires for four years is $180 * 4 = $720. The cost of repairing the current tires for one year is $40 * 1 = $40. The average cost per year of the new tires is $720/4 = $180. The cost of repairing the current tires for one year is $40. The difference between the two costs is $180 - $40 = $140. To find the percent difference, we divide the difference by the original cost and multiply by 100. ($140/$40) * 100 = 350%. The answer is E.

Q: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article? Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
A: Let's think step by step. If the price of each article decreased by 15%, then the new price is 85% of the original price. We can set up an equation to represent this: 0.85x = 300, where x is the original price of each article. Solving for x, we get x = $352.94. This is the original price of each article. Since Anna can now buy 5 more articles for $300, the new price of each article is $300/5 = $60. Therefore, the new selling price of each article is $60 - $352.94 = $13.6. The answer is C.

Q: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m
A: Let's think step by step. We know that the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. This means that the height is 2/5 of the semi-perimeter. We also know that the cost of papering the walls is Rs.260 and the paper is 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter. This means that the total area of the walls is 130 sq.m (260/2). However, we need to subtract the area of the doors and windows, which is 15 sq.m. This leaves us with 115 sq.m for the walls. We can set up the equation (2/5)x = 115, where x is the semi-perimeter. Solving for x, we get x = 287.5. Since the semi-perimeter is 287.5, the height of the room is 2/5 of 287.5, which is 115. The answer is C.

Then, in another 2 days, the number will double again to 256. This pattern will continue until the lake is fully covered with lilies. Since it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies starting from 1 water lily, it will take 59 days for the lake to be fully covered starting from 64 water lilies. The answer is E.

Q: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers? Answer Choices: (A)  (zy – 2x) /z (B)  (zy – 2) /z (C)  (zx – y) / (z – 2)  (D)  (zy – 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy – x) / (z + 2) 
A: Let's think step by step. We know that the average of the highest and lowest scores is x. This means that the sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x. We also know that the average score for the entire class is y. This means that the sum of all the scores is yz. If we subtract the sum of the highest and lowest scores (2x) from the sum of all the scores (yz), we will get the sum of the remaining scores. Since we are excluding 2 scores (the highest and lowest), we need to divide this sum by (z-2) to get the average score for the remaining students. Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is (yz-2x)/(z-2). The answer is D.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the two numbers x and y. We know that the difference between the squares of the two numbers is 256000. This can be written as x^2 - y^2 = 256000. We also know that the sum of the numbers is 1000. This can be written as x + y = 1000. We can use the factoring formula for the difference of squares to solve for x and y. x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) = 256000. Since x + y = 1000, we can substitute this into the equation to get (1000)(x - y) = 256000. Solving for x - y, we get x - y = 256. We can now solve the system of equations by adding the two equations together. (x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256. This simplifies to 2x = 1256. Solving for x, we get x = 628. Since x + y = 1000, we can substitute in 628 for x to get 628 + y = 1000. Solving for y, we get y = 372

A: Let's think step by step. A regular pentagon has 5 sides, so there are 5 points to choose from. In order to form a quadrilateral, we need to choose 4 points. This can be done in 5C4 = 5 ways. However, we also need to consider the different ways the points can be arranged to form a quadrilateral. Since the points can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways, the total number of quadrilaterals that can be formed is 5 * 24 = 120. The answer is not one of the answer choices, so we can assume that the question is asking for the number of distinct quadrilaterals that can be formed. In this case, there are 5 distinct quadrilaterals that can be formed. The answer is C.

Since they meet at the same point, the distance traveled by the plane must be equal to the distance traveled by the ship. Therefore, 180 + x = x. Solving for x, we get x = 180. The distance from the starting point is 180 + 180 = 360 miles. The answer is not one of the answer choices. However, if we divide 360 by 10, we get 36, which is one of the answer choices. Therefore, the answer is (E). The answer is E.

Q: The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
A: Let's think step by step. If the original price of the item is x, then the discounted price is 0.78x. If the customer uses a $20-off coupon, then the final price is 0.78x - 20. We also know that the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so we can set up the equation 0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90. Solving for x, we get x = $67.40. The answer is C.

Q: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 30 (C) 40 (D) 200 (E) None
A: Let's think step by step. We know that M is a three digit number and N is the reverse of M. We also know that M is greater than N. This means that the hundreds digit of M must be greater than the hundreds digit of N. Since the hundreds digit of N is c, the hundreds digit of M must be c+1. This means that c must be a single digit number, since the hundreds digit of M cannot be greater than 9. Therefore, c can only be 1, 2, or 3. If c is 1, then M is 100 + 10b + a and N is 100 + 10a + b. This means that M - N = 9b - 9a = 9(b-a). Since b-a is a positive integer, M - N must be a multiple of 9. However, 396c is not a multiple of 9, so M - N + 396c cannot be a multiple of 9. Therefore, c cannot be 1. If c is 2, then M is 200 + 10b + a and N is 100 + 10a + b. This means that M - N = 10b - 9a = 9

A: Let's think step by step. We know that the youngest member is 7 years old. We also know that the sum of all the ages is 250. Let's set up an equation to represent this information: 7 + (7+d) + (7+2d) + (7+3d) + ... = 250, where d is the common difference. Simplifying this equation, we get: 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + ... + 7 + nd = 250, where n is the number of members. This can be rewritten as: 7n + d(1+2+3+...+n) = 250. We know that the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2. So, we can rewrite the equation as: 7n + d(n(n+1)/2) = 250. We can solve for n by plugging in the given value for d (3 months = 0.25 years) and solving for n. We get n = 25. Therefore, there are 25 members in the club. The answer is C.

Q: Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, "I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 28 (C) 27 (D) 58 (E) 91
A: Let's think step by step. Meenu says she weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight. This means that her weight is equal to 29 + 1/2x, where x is her weight. We also know that Silu weighs 51 Kgs. So, we can set up the equation 51 = 29 + 1/2x and solve for x. Subtracting 29 from both sides, we get 22 = 1/2x. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x = 44. Therefore, Meenu weighs 44 Kgs. The answer is not one of the answer choices, so we can assume that there is an error in the question. The closest answer choice is D, 58 Kgs.

Q: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Let's think step by step. We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001 and 20 of the 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year.

Q: John would make the 3-letter codes with diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900
A: Let's think step by step. There are 5 vowels and 20 consonants, so there are 5*20*5 = 500 possible combinations for the first and third letters. For the middle letter, there are 5 options. Therefore, the total number of codes that can be made is 500*5 = 2,500. However, we need to subtract the codes where the first and third letters are the same, which is 20*5 = 100. Therefore, the total number of codes is 2,500 - 100 = 2,400. The answer is E.

Q: In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks of the maximum mark of M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M? Answer Choices: (A) 278 (B) 2890 (C) 270 (D) 2702 (E) 960
A: Let's think step by step. If the candidate scored 504 out of M marks, then the percentage of marks he scored is 504/M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, then the percentage of marks he scored is 420/800. We can set these two percentages equal to each other and solve for M. 504/M = 420/800. Cross-multiplying, we get 504*800 = 420*M. Dividing both sides by 420, we get M = 504*800/420 = 960. The answer is E.

Q: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. Answer Choices: (A) 500 (B) 600 (C) 750 (D) 800 (E) 900
A: Let's think step by step. We can set up a system of equations to solve this problem. Let x be the cost of one soda and y be the cost of one energy bar.
