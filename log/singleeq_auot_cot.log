Q: Trenton sells electronic supplies. Each week he earns 190 dollars plus commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. This week his goal is to earn no less than 500 dollars. How much sales  he must make to reach his goal?
A: Let's think step by step. Trenton earns 190 dollars plus 0.04 of his sales. This means that his total earnings must be at least 500 dollars. We can write this as an equation: 190 + 0.04x = 500, where x is the amount of sales he must make. To solve for x, we need to subtract 190 from both sides: 0.04x = 310. Then, we divide both sides by 0.04 to isolate x: x = 310/0.04 = 7750. Therefore, Trenton must make at least 7750 dollars in sales to reach his goal. The answer is 7750 dollars. The answer is 7750.

Q: The sum of three consecutive even numbers is 162. What is the smallest of the three numbers ?
A: Let's think step by step. We know that the numbers are consecutive even numbers, which means they are all 2 apart from each other. So, we can represent the numbers as x, x+2, and x+4. We also know that the sum of these numbers is 162. So, we can write the equation: x + (x+2) + (x+4) = 162. Simplifying this equation, we get 3x + 6 = 162. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get 3x = 156. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 52. Therefore, the smallest of the three numbers is 52. The answer is 52. The answer is 52.
